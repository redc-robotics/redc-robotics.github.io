				<h2>redC Philosophy</h2>

				<p>
					As I have done more and more research into the area of submersible technology,
    				I have come to the conclusion that the technology market is on the brink of an
    			    "underwater revolution." The untapped potential of Earth's bodies of water is
        			starting to come to light.  Based on the idea that "data centers love remote,
        			cold environments," Microsoft has recently been testing just that.  It is even
        			possible to have an underwater turbine power this data center.  On another note
        			National Geographic reports that, "the deep sea contains enough mineable gold that
        			there's nine pounds (four kilograms) of it for every person on Earth." So why
        			haven't projects like this been carried out to a greater extent yet?  In my opinion,
        			it is because we lack the tools and methodology needed to safely, successfully, and
        			consistently bring technology underwater.  What my team is doing is making an
        			imperative tool that will be of paramount importance to any underwater project,
        			venture, or exploration.  Not only are we creating the tool, but we are attempting
        			to do so in a modular and efficient way such that this technology can be available
        			and of use to any underwater project.  Along with this, we are developing new and
        			innovative ways of integrating water with technology.  The technology we are
        			creating will be deeply integrated in the ventures of the future.
